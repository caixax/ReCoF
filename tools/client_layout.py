"""Reconstruct the object layout of a DLL without a PDB (client.dll).

  python tools/client_layout.py [<dll>] [--write]

The linker places the functions of one object together, objects in link
order. A function whose name came from a reference object
(evidence "refbytes:<repo>:<dir>__<file>.obj") or that has a confirmed
source_file is an anchor for that file. This walks the functions in
address order and prints, per file, the address range spanned by its
anchors, how many functions lie in it and the anchors of other files
inside it (a conflict: a wrong byte match, an inline function emitted in
the first object that uses it, or a file that really is split).

With --write, every non-LIB row between two anchors of the same file
(with no anchor of another file in between) gets that file as its
source_file ("guess:" kept for rows that are not anchors), written to
docs/progress.csv. Rows that are anchors themselves get their file if
they have none.
